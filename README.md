# sse-showcase

A project that shows how to use [server-sent events (SSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events) using a simple Node.js server in sse-server and a Next.js frontend in sse-front.

To get started, run the server:

```
node sse-server/index.js
```

Then, prepare frontend:

```
cd sse-front
npm install
npm run dev
```

That's all, enjoy.
